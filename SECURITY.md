# Security Policy
 CryptedXLS does not automatically update your version when there is a vulnerability in the version you are using, instead you should not update it manually or using CryptedXlS Installer. To understand if there is a vulnerability in the version of CryptedXls you are using, you can start CyptedXLS and look at the text at the top left. If there is a vulnerability in the version you are using, this section will say "The version you are using contains a vulnerability, please update CryptedXLs" and it will look like the picture below.

## Supported Versions
 CryptedXLS provides security for all current versions, but only the latest versions of the code have the issue resolved. This is because CryptedXLS was not built to update the problematic version, but instead released a version of CryptedXLS that does not contain the latest updates and the existing issue.
