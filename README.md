# CryptedXLS

CryptedXLS is a program that can perform basic and advanced encryption and decryption. CryptedXLS uses a 256-bit 2-layer encryption logic. In addition to 256-bit encryption, it makes passwords even stronger by using KDF and salt. Thanks to KDF, CryptedXLS allows more secure passwords to be created than simple passwords, so the user's data is encrypted with additional security methods. 

KDA: MyPassword = b74cde1a6c8d6743e1e9f47c2e4d5d75e2fef9b1b6e78b7e2f5a8d57e90a1234

KDA: MyPassword = c58d1e7f43b5a9b9c1d6e2f3e4f7d8e2b9c0a1d2e3f4g5h6i7j8k9l0m1n2o3p

What is 256-bit Encryption

This algorithm is one of the most secure and modern encryption algorithms that can be preferred after 128-bit and 192-bit encryption algorithms. 256-bit encryption makes all data much more secure in case they can break 128-bit encryption.


128-bit: Hello World = fOOQBTkM1wZ7htaaQRGJDw==
192-bit: Hello World = s6iZhTsAVLjTeumxYR7Q6A==
256-bit: Hello World = +yOl56UaaNo/FvD0Wh1J0w==
