# CryptedXLS

 CryptedXLS is a program that can perform basic and advanced encryption and decryption. CryptedXLS uses a 256-bit 2-layer encryption logic. In addition to 256-bit encryption, it makes passwords even stronger by using KDF and salt. Thanks to KDF, CryptedXLS allows more secure passwords to be created than simple passwords, so the user's data is encrypted with additional security methods.

> ### How does KDA work?
> 
>  KDA recreates the same password as a different password, thus  converting a simple password into a stronger one. And it does this  without requiring you to memorize a new password. Below, as an example, the same two passwords have been re-encrypted with KDA.
> ```
> KDA: MyPassword = b74cde1a6c8d6743e1e9f47c2e4d5d75e2fef9b1b6e78b7e2f5a8d57e90a1234
> ```
> ```
> KDA: MyPassword = c58d1e7f43b5a9b9c1d6e2f3e4f7d8e2b9c0a1d2e3f4g5h6i7j8k9l0m1n2o3p

> ### What is 256-bit Encryption?
> 
>  This algorithm is one of the most secure and modern encryption algorithms that can be preferred after 128-bit and 192-bit encryption algorithms. 256-bit encryption makes all data much more secure in case they can break 128-bit encryption.
> 
>  The higher the bit rate in encryption, the stronger and more unpredictable the encryption will be. For example, the probability of repeating some characters in 128-bit encryption is very low in 256-bit encryption.

> 128-bit: Hello World = fOOQBTkM1wZ7htaaQRGJDw==

> ```
> 192-bit: Hello World = s6iZhTsAVLjTeumxYR7Q6A==
> ```
> ```
> 256-bit: Hello World = +yOl56UaaNo/FvD0Wh1J0w==
